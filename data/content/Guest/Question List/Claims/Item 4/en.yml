  Description: |
    <p style="color: #323232; background-color: #ffffff;">If the primary beneficiary dies before the insured, the benefits are payable to the contingent (or secondary) beneficiary. If no provisions were made for a contingent beneficiary, the benefits are payable to the estate of the insured.</p>
    <p style="color: #323232; background-color: #ffffff;">If the primary beneficiary passed away after the insured (but before benefits were paid), the benefits are payable to the estate of the beneficiary.</p>
    <p style="color: #323232; background-color: #ffffff;">If benefits are payable to an estate, the court appointed representative should complete the claimant's statement, and a copy of the appointment document should be provided with the other documents requested. Refer to&nbsp;<a href="#" style="color: #14578f;" data-bs-target="#collapse-item-1113" class="faq-jumplink">"How Do I Submit A Life Insurance Claim"</a>&nbsp;for claim filing instructions.</p>
